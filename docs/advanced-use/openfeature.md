title: OpenFeature
---

[OpenFeature](https://openfeature.dev/) is an open standard for feature flag management, created to support a robust
feature flag ecosystem using cloud native technologies. OpenFeature provides a unified API and SDK, and a
developer-first, cloud-native implementation, with extensibility for open source and commercial offerings.

Flagsmith is proud to contribute to this initiative, and is a governance board member of this CNCF project.

OpenFeature is still in it's alpha stage, but we encourage anyone interested Feature Flags and Open Source to get
involved! We will be adding to this page of our docs as the project progresses.

Our goal, and that of OpenFeature, is to recommend using OpenFeature as the default SDK interface for Flagsmith
projects.
